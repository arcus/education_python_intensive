## What Even *Is* Python, Anyway?

While the word "python" might immediately make you think of a snake, that's not all it is! Python refers to a programming language. There are a lot of different programming languages for a variety of tasks, but what they all have in common is that they tell your computer what to do. Behind all of your favorite applications is a software developer (or, more often, several developers) who have written the instructions for the computer in a programming language. Python is a particularly versatile language that can be used for web development, data science, machine learning, and more.

So why should you consider Python for your data analysis? There are a few reasons:

* Python is that it is designed to be *human readable*. It's philosophy is centered around producing simple, efficient, easy-to-read code, but you shouldn't get too hung up on that-- code that works for you is good code! Creating human-readable code is great for research because your analyses can be more reproducible (if you know exactly what you did, you can reproduce it) and transparent (writing the methods section of your paper is much easier when you have clear language as to what you did and why).

* Python is free to download and use, and it is an *open source* language, meaning that updates and innovations happen more quickly than proprietary software (to learn more about open source, see **link to open source module**).

* Because Python is quite popular and fairly mature, there are quite a lot of resources out there to help you get started learning, from free online tutorials and cheatsheets to semester-long courses, and everything in between.

Python can be written in several ways. You can write Python code interactively using your computer's Terminal program or Command Line, you can write scripts that include Python code, or you can create Python notebooks using Jupyter or Google Colaboratory (or "Colab" for short). In most cases, you'll need to start with downloading Python to your computer (the exception will be if you are using cloud-based solutions like Google Colab).

### What does Python code look like?

There are a variety of ways that people write Python code, depending on their goals. 

## How do I get Python on my Computer?

Your computer most likely will *not* have Python already installed. To check, you can open your Command Line/Terminal and type `python --version`. The version you have will be displayed if you have Python installed. If you don't, you can go [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the latest version.

Alternatively, you can install Python using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), a toolkit that gives you not only Python itself but also many other data science tools to help with coding, analysis, and visualization. The individual version of Anaconda is also free to download!
